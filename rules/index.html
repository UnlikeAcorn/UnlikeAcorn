                    <ul>
                        <li>Like any other user of our service, you can send a complaint (report) against your interlocutor. Along with the complaint, our moderators receive a screenshot of the interlocutor's video and his/her message (if any). Moderators check every complaint for a possible violation and decide if it requires banning the interlocutor from the video chat. Moderators monitor users' complaints 24/7, including weekends and holidays.</li>
                        <li>Our system automatically bans any user who gets numerous complaints within a short time. It helps identify violations that are otherwise difficult to detect. The system considers numerous factors that exclude accidental or unjustified bans.</li>
                        <li>By using our service, you accept our current complaint procedures. Please remember that other users may also send complaints against you, which may lead to an automatic ban.</li>
                        <li>If your interlocutor violates the chat rules or behaves offensively towards you, please do not respond with an offense or violation. If you do so, you will become a violator and may be banned.</li>

                      <li>If you are considered a minor in your country, under no circumstances should you use our service, even with your parent's or legal guardian's permission or supervision.</li>
                      <li>If you see a child in the video chat, please send a complaint to our moderators, so they can quickly respond and ban the minor from using the service.</li>

                <h3>Our Vision and Recommendations</h3>
                <p>In our view, the exemplary user of our service is a polite, open, and friendly person who always behaves respectfully and never insults other people. This view underlies our approach to moderation.</p>
                <p>The following guidelines will help you get the best experience and avoid unpleasant situations when using the video chat.</p>
                <p><strong>Keep your face visible.</strong> Our users want to see who they are talking to. Do not cover your face, and make sure it is visible in the camera frame. If you are uncomfortable with showing your face, you may want to switch to other platforms that have the option for chatting without video. Hiding your face while seeing others is unfair to your interlocutors.</p>
                <p><strong>Turn on the light.</strong> Our users naturally expect to see each other clearly in the video chat. Darkness is hardly conducive to proper communication, so please use  the video chat in a well-lit environment. You have plenty of time to adjust the camera and find the best light and angle before starting the conversation.</p>
                <p><strong>Appear well dressed.</strong> The video chat is a public space, and you should look as if you were among people or in public. Please remember that you are visiting the video chat; our users are not visiting you at home. Do not take off your shirt or stay in your underwear, even if it is hot. Understandably, other people might not like it, and you may be banned.</p>
                <p><strong>Pay attention to what is caught on camera.</strong> When using the video chat, you can switch between the front (selfie mode enabled by default) and the rear camera (depending on the device type). Always keep forbidden objects or situations from being caught on either of the cameras. Please make sure to exclude from view everything prohibited by the rules, especially before switching to the rear camera. Do not overuse the rear camera, and avoid showing your surroundings and aiming the camera at other people from afar. For face-to-face communication, this is unnecessary, and you may unintentionally violate the rules. Instead, let your interlocutor see you most of the time.</p>
                <p><strong>No 'second-hand' streaming.</strong> Avoid aiming the camera at a TV, PC, laptop, or any other device screen — even if you think something exciting is going on there. Let people watch TV or videos on the internet on their own whenever and wherever they wish, just not in our video chat.</p>
                <p><strong>No video game streaming either.</strong> The no-streaming rule also applies to video games. There are many other online platforms where our users stream their games or follow popular streamers. They use our video chat only for face-to-face communication and never for watching or streaming video games.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not use the video chat in lavatories or bathrooms.</strong> These are the designated personal hygiene spaces. People tend to interpret your actions there differently than if you were in other rooms.</p>
                <p><strong>A violation is always a violation.</strong> Unfortunately, this is the case, even if it happens by accident. It is impossible to verify if a user violated the rules accidentally or deliberately. Therefore, our moderators respond to the violation rather than its reasons because it is impossible to determine the causes objectively. For example, if you accidentally drop your device and the camera caught something prohibited by the rules, it will always be counted as a violation.</p>
                <p><strong>Even fleeting abuse may lead to a ban.</strong> The gravity of the violation does not depend on its duration. It does not make any difference if it lasts just a second or a whole couple of minutes. Therefore, it helps if you stay cautious and self-aware of your activities when using our video chat.</p>
                <p><strong>Make sure your camera works.</strong> Please do not use the video chat with a faulty or disabled camera. When your interlocutors cannot see you, their experience suffers. It must not happen, especially because of someone's defective device.</p>
                <p><strong>Never 'lend'  your device to others when using the video chat.</strong> Do not let other people use the video chat on your device without your consent or if you are unsure if they are familiar with the chat rules. You are the only one held responsible for the content transmitted from your device in the video chat. Any violation caused by your friend, a relative, or anyone else on your device is considered your own.</p>
                <p><strong>Think before you act.</strong> If your interlocutor asks you to do something or awaits a specific action or response from you, please think if this will contradict the rules. It is in your best interest to withhold any provoked action that may lead to a ban.</p>
                <p><strong>Disconnect when you need to leave.</strong> Do not leave the video chat in a connected state if you need to step out, even for a brief moment. Spare your interlocutors from staring at a ceiling or empty walls. Disconnect before you get busy with something else (answering a call, opening a door, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>Never respond with "an eye for an eye."</strong> Our advanced reporting system helps moderators promptly respond to violations and bans those who violate the chat rules. Please consistently  report violators but never respond with an offense. Our moderators review every case separately  without tracing back the reasons. Thus, you are held responsible for any inappropriate response and might be banned as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Be careful and mind your privacy.</strong> Never share your personal information or any sensitive or private data with your interlocutor unless you are fully aware of the associated risks and ready to bear  full responsibility for any consequences of such sharing. Last but not least, always be cautious when making an appointment with someone you have just met in the video chat.</p>
                <h3>Changes and Revisions</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to change, revise, or modify any part of these rules at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to check the rules periodically for changes. You can study the rules before using the service (before starting a connection in the video chat). By starting a connection, you confirm acceptance of those changes.</p>
